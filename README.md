- The project sought to develop a predictive model for estimating property prices, utilising supervised learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural networks, Random Forest, linear regression and regression trees.

- The house price prediction project was created to work out how much houses could be worth using supervised learning techniques. The model can be used in the following ways: to check how much people can borrow for a mortgage, to refinance, and to monitor collateral in real estate. This makes it a useful tool for the financial sector.
  
- A range of modelling techniques were implemented and evaluated in order to address the estimation of house prices. The models explored included Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Random Forest, Linear Predictor Regression and Regression Trees. Each of these models was evaluated in terms of their ability to capture relationships between housing characteristics and prices. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used in a regression approach, Neural Networks sought to capture complex patterns across multiple layers, and Random Forest combined multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. The Linear Predictor Regression approach was found to be simple and easily interpretable. However, Regression Trees were determined to be more suitable due to their capacity to capture both linear and non-linear relationships.

- Following a thorough evaluation of the available options, it was determined that Regression Trees would provide the optimal blend of accuracy and interpretability, which are paramount for practical applications in industry. Despite the competitive performance exhibited by Linear Regression in terms of the coefficient of determination (RÂ²), Regression Trees offered enhanced flexibility and a superior fit to the intricacies inherent in the house price estimation problem.

- The project encountered some challenges, including issues with data quality, such as missing values and outliers, as well as difficulties in interpreting complex models. To address these challenges, advanced cleaning and visualisation techniques were employed, along with hyperparameter adjustment and ensemble approaches to optimise the models. The implementation of cross-validation and the selection of relevant features were important in ensuring the accuracy, robustness, and generalisability of the models to new data.
